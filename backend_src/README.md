## How to Develop
- Add CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET to your environment
- Add REDIRECT_URI to your environment (should be 'http://localhost:9000' locally
- `yarn install` and `yarn run dev` in /backend_src/ will operate both services at the same time
``` sh
yarn install
yarn run dev
```
- HTTP API runs on localhost:8080
- Mongo runs on localhost:27017
